  #Modify TotalConnectClient.py
    #vi /mnt/cache/local/hass_extras/TotalConnectClient.py
    #Scroll to the correct line (145) (if device[‘DevieName’] ==) and add in ‘Lynx Touch-WiFi’ as option
      #‘I’ to insert
      #‘x’ when in Command Mode (ESC) to delete old characters
      #‘:x” when in Command Mode (ESC) to save and quit

  #To find the device name I needed to modify the sub to print out each name it iterated across.  Mine turned out to be ‘Lynx Touch-WiFi’ – see below code snippet
